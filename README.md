# work-day-scheduler

This calendar application allows a worker to save tasks hour-by-hour. To do so they type in the field, and click the lock icon on the right to store it locally. The worker can then delete or adjust their entries as they wish. 

The hour rows will display RED for the current hour, GREEN for future hours, and GRAY that are already past.

Using Moment.js, the current date and time will always display below the header.
